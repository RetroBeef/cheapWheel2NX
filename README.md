# cheapWheel2NX
RP2040 Firmware for making cheap old steering wheels work with racing games on a switch  

# Description
This was essentially a mashup of the host_hid_to_device_cdc example from Pico-PIO-USB and the tinyusb HID example to make a cheap old steering wheel work with some racing games on a switch, but now it also supports the _Logitech Speed Force Wii_ wheel, which I got for 10â‚¬ on ebay.  

# Motivation
Initially I tried Mayflash _Magic-NS V1_ and _V2_ and while my _Thrustmaster T150RS_ works very good with those, my cheap _tracer_ and the _Logitech Speed Force Wii_ did not.  
So I tried to DIY some solutions with usb host and device capabilities and stuck with RP2040 because of simplicity and price :)
